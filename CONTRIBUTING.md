# Contributing to eslint-plugin-prototype-pollution

We welcome contributions to this plugin, including pull requests and issues
reporting problems and suggesting new features.

## Code of Conduct

Though not an official part of the project, I'd like us to follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) code of conduct.

## Issues

Please file issues for any problems you find or features you'd like to see.

## Development

Please open an issue before starting work on a pull request. This will help us
to provide feedback on your contribution and let you know if there are others
working on the same thing.

If you add a new rule, please remember to add tests to it. If you're not sure
how to do that, please ask and I'll be happy to help.

We work on the main branch, so please base your pull requests there. We aim to follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and will release new versions as
needed.

## Personal note

I'm not a security expert, and I'm not a JavaScript expert. I'm just a developer, like you, who wants to make the world a better place. I'm happy to accept your contributions. I'm learning as I go, and I'm happy to learn from you.
